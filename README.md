# Introduction

Hello there! You have stumbled upon my data visualization project archive, where I upload all of the data visualization projects that I have worked on. There is material ranging from mini data visualization projects to project showcases. 

# Mini Projects
This section is where my mini projects for data visualization are displayed. The goal here is to learn the tools needed to perform EDA and data visualization.

### SEA Environmental Analysis

This project aims to provide a data visualization of the greenhouse gasses emitted by Southeast Asian countries between 2015-2021. The tools used to perform this task were Pyspark and Tableau due to the dataset containing over 10 million rows. Indeed, this can be considered my first 'Big Data' project. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle, courtesy of Michael Bryant (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michaelbryantds/greenhouse-gas-emissions-dataset). The resulting data visualization indicated that the highest emitted gas was carbon dioxide equivalent (20 years), which was surprising, to say the least since the trend seems to be constant throughout the years. The final visualization can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/christopher.sastropranoto/viz/EnvironmentSEA/Dashboard1?publish=yes
